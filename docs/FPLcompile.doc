3.	What is Compiling

 Compiling in general means that the source text is interpreted and converted
into a format more easily understood and faster executed. Normally, compilers
compile ASCII text files into machine code binary programs, using CPU
instructions. The FPL Compiler is not like that, it compiles the standard
ASCII text file into a FPL improved instruction set format, that is more
easily understood and quicker read by the FPL interpreter engine.

4.	Compiling Phases

 The compiling is done in several different phases. This is generally not
important to you as a user, with exception for the preprocessor phase.

 The compiling always (if not disabled through a command line parameter)
starts with "preprocessing" the source file. Preprocessing means that all
#-instructions (like #define, #ifdef, #include, #else, etc) are resolved. See
the Preprocessor Instructions section for detailed information about those.

 The next phase is the syntax-check-phase. The entire source file is now
scanned again and the syntax/usage is controlled and piped further into the
next phase. Any sever misuse of the language will be discovered in this phase
and reported to the terminal.

 The actual compiling phase converts the previous source format into the new
one. This phase will also contain all sorts of optimizing in the future.

4.	Compiling Phases


5.	Compiled Format

 Compiled files include information that might be of interest for you to know
about. It is among other things:

  * Lowest FPL version required to run the program.

  * Version number of the compiler that generated the program.

  * File name of the original FPL program source.

  * Little/bin endian information. The compiled program does only work on
    machines with the same endian status that is stored in the compiled
    file. If you don't know what this means and don't intend to move compiled
    programs from one platform to another, just ignore this!

  Optionally [debug] info:

  * All external references gathered at one place. If this hunk is present,
    all these names will be checked on load-time, to make sure that no
    function in the file referes to a non-existing function/varible.

  * Line number of the source file. To easier trace bugs back to the original
    file.

 One of the main gains with this gathered information is that a compiled
program can never get executed by a too old FPL version.

 With this new, compiled custom format, we have introduced a free-form way to
improve things in FPL in the future. By allowing the compiled format to
change, we can improve compiling and add optimizing stages as long as we can
program them.

6.	Requirements

 It might require some time from you, humble user, but I've disregarded that
simple matter in the following section! ;)

 The FPL Compiler Environment doesn't require much. Hardly anything actually!
I just think it should be pointed out here that the FPL Compiler is of no use
whatsoever without you using one or more programs that run(s) FPL programs.
The 'FPLc' executable program requires the 'cpp' program to be put in the
system path before run, that's all!

 NOTE: the compiler is still designed to load the entire source file into
memory before any compiling is done, why the memory amount of your machine
might limit the size of FPL programs possible to compile!

7.	Installation

 Make sure the 'cpp' executable is in the system path before FPLc is run, or
use the 'CPP' command line option to specify the complete path to that or a
similar preprocessing program (any C-compiler's preprocessor is likely to work
pretty smoothly together with FPLc).

8.	Limitations

 Some critical uses of FPL that is supported, but not supported in C, is no
longer suppored when FPLCompiling. The most obvious one is continuation of
string constants without the use of a backslash character (\), as in:

    string WorkedBefore = "line one
            ----->         line two";

 that will cause the preprocessor to go crazy, instead use:


                                  - Page 3 -
8.	Limitations

    string WorksNow = "line one\
            ----->     line two";

9.	File Naming Standards

 With this compiler, we have decided to set a file naming standard. We have
decided that the default extensions used by any program that deals with FPL
programs should be

 .FPL - for uncompiled, interpreted regular ASCII text FPL sources

 .FPC - for compiled, custom format FPL programs

 Any other can in most cases very well be used, but these mentioned are the
ones we recommend and those *we* will use for most of our work. The FPL
interpreter will also feature mechanisms in which the .FPL/.FPC extentions
will be required to enable them. That is i.e for the moment an automatic
run-the-compiled-version-of-a-FPL-program-if-there-is-one-newer-than-the-
FPL-source function.

10.	Things to Consider

* The FPL Compiler is much more 'observant' than the interpreter. Some of the
  minor mistakes you've done in your programs and that have always worked
  when interpreting your FPL programs may cause the compiler to spit. Be
  aware of the fact that the interpreter never syntax check anything it
  doesn't interpret. Rubbish in between functions are never discovered.

* Typing mistakes such as spelling variable or functions names slightly
  different than they're actually named are generally *not* discovered by the
  compiler, but it will merely suppose it means accessing an out-of-file
  declaration of that variable/function. Use the VERBOSE command line flag
  for displaying external references to trap such kind of mistakes.

* Exported/trans-file variables and functions are much slower to access than
  local versions. Use local variables and functions as far as you can.

11.	Using the Compiler

 The FPL Compiler is only available from a shell prompt. [Amiga] Future
versions may be WB-runnable.

 Quick n' Easy
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  fplc <file>

 More Detailed
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Usage: FPLc [options] <file(s)>

 Where available options are as follows:

     COMMENTNEST   - Allow nested comments in source files.

     CPP <path>    - Alter the name of the preprocessor program.

     DEBUG <flag>  - Include debug info in the input. Flags available are:
                        LINE   - source file line number info

     FILES         - The rest of the command line is treated as file names.

     FILE          - The next argument is a file name.

     NOVERSION     - Don't display compiler version information.

     NOCPP         - Run the compiler without preprocessing the input
                     file(s).

                                  - Page 4 -
11.	Using the Compiler


     OUTPUT <name> - Output name or directory. To specify a directory, end
                     the name with a '/' (or ':' on Amiga).

     PPOPTS <opts> - Set preprocessor-specific options (passed on to the 
                     preprocessor invoke).

     VERBOSE <flag> - Produce verbose report on the compiled code.
                     <flag> defines which information:
                        PASS1  - Output from Pass1
                        PASS2  - Output from Pass2
                        PASS3  - Output from Pass3
                        FINAL  - Final result
                        FULL   - Full output
                     You may be requested to run the compiler with this
option
                     if you have filed us a bug report!

 The order of options and file names are not important.

12.	Source / Compiling the Compiler

 Included in this package (or if not, available on request from any of us
authors) is the complete source code required to build the complete compiler,
preprocessor and optimizer.

 To compile it, it should be a case of selecting which makefile that suits
your needs/equipment best and run 'make -f <makefile>'. If you experience
compiling errors/warnings and fix them for a particular OS/compiler/machine, I
would very much like to get my hands on those! If you can't fix them yourself,
ask us, we might help you if it isn't too much and we aren't under too heavy
work-load.

13.	Authors of All This

 FPL is mainly written by Daniel Stenberg. I started 1992 on writing the
interpreter and has since then continously updated and developed it. FPL has
been successfully compiled and run under at least 10 differen OSes, and more
are very likely to be able to run it if anyone ever wanna port it...

 This compiler development would never have become reality without the
extensive help Kjell Ericson put into the project. He wrote the "3rd" stage of
the compiler and is still kind of "responsible" for it (developing, bug
fixing, etc).

 Linus Nielsen helped me out on the somewhat fuzzy area of expression
optimizing. "1+A+1" actually becomes "2+A" now! ;)

 Anyone out there feels like giving us a hand in this project? Just send us a
line, you don't even have to be an Amiga developer since all FPL with compiler
is very much multi-platform.
