LibList lists all libraries currently in memory and has a few
small extra functions that helps you handle libraries!

I made this little utility while developing FPL, since it helped me a lot
to e.g keep two versions of the same library in memory simultanously (through
the PUSH parameter), kill libraries that are left in memory and by accident
never was closed properly (through the KILL parameter) and make programs use
libraries that are not in LIBS: (by the OPEN parameter)...


   USAGE:
   ~~~~~

* LibList [pattern] lists only those libraries that matches the
  given AmigaDOS style pattern

* LibList KILL <library name> performs a dirty and absolute removal
  of the specified library. No mercy. Programs using the killed
  library will most likely crash with a blast!
  The deletion is performed by setting the open counter to zero and
  then calling the library's Expunge() vector.

* LibList PUSH <library name> performs a slight renaming of the
  mentioned library. Efficiant when programs already are using a
  library and you want to be able to open another version of it
  without affecting the rest of the system. The renaming is also
  a very dirty trick that simply increases the first character in
  the library name!

* LibList OPEN <file name> opens the specified file as a library, and
  immediately closes it! Made to enable easy replacing of libraries
  currently in memory.

* LibList NICE <library name> tries to kill the specified library
  the proper way. This can only succeed if the library isn't
  currently opened.

* LibList FLUSH [pattern] simply flushes all libraries in memory that
  match the AmigaDOS style pattern and are not currently in use
  This is the same as trying a LibList NICE on all libraries in memory.
